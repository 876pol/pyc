# pyc

Interpreted C-like programming language written with Python 3. Created as my ICS3U (Grade 11 Computer Science) final.

## Features

- Initializing variables
- Evaluating expressions
- Control Structures
- Functions
- Arrays
- C-like syntax

## Installation

To clone this repository and run a program:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/876pol/pyc.git
cd pyc
python pyc examples/hello_world.pysc
```

More sample programs can be found in `/examples`.

## Known Bugs / Limitations

- Many error messages are not clear.
- The standard library is limited (there are only functions for input and output).
- pyc has a string data type instead of a char array (like in C), and string manipulation is not possible.
- Features such as pointers or structs are unavailable.
